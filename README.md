Welcome to the NeuraFLY project repository! NeuraFLY is an educational initiative aimed at exploring the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into flight controller systems for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). This project serves as a learning resource for students, hobbyists, and enthusiasts interested in aerospace engineering, robotics, and AI.

## Project Goals

The primary goal of the NeuraFLY project is to develop a sophisticated flight controller system capable of autonomous flight control for UAVs, leveraging AI algorithms to enhance intelligence, decision-making, and adaptability. Specifically, the project aims to:

- Design and implement firmware and software for the flight controller system.
- Integrate sensors for data acquisition and environmental awareness.
- Develop control algorithms for stabilization, navigation, and autonomous operation.
- Incorporate AI techniques such as neural networks, reinforcement learning, or machine learning for advanced flight control capabilities.
- Provide educational resources, tutorials, and documentation to support learning and experimentation with UAV technology and AI integration.

## Project Structure

The NeuraFLY project is organized into several components, including:

1. **Software Development**: This component focuses on designing and implementing the firmware and software for the flight controller system. It involves programming in languages such as C/C++ for embedded systems development.

2. **Hardware Integration**: The hardware integration component involves selecting and configuring hardware components such as microcontrollers, sensors, and peripherals for the flight controller system.

3. **AI Integration**: In this component, AI techniques are integrated into the flight controller system to enhance autonomous flight control capabilities. This may include implementing neural networks, reinforcement learning algorithms, or other machine learning models.

4. **Documentation and Educational Resources**: Educational materials, tutorials, and documentation are provided to guide users through the project, facilitate learning, and encourage experimentation with UAV technology and AI integration.
